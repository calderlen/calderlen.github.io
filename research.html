                        <h3>Characterizing exoplanet atmospheres</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong>High-level overview:</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Ultra hot Jupiters are an exceptional class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet">exoplanets</a>. They rapidly orbit their host stars in close proximity, so they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidally locked</a> with puffy atmospheres that reach more than 2,200 degrees Kelvin. With high-quality observations, we can study the extreme physics that is theorized to occur in these atmospheres. We observed one such exoplanet, KELT-20b, with the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) located in Mt. Graham, Arizona.</p>
                        
                        <p>To examine the atmosphere, we collect the light from the host star that passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere during a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_transit">transit</a>, some of which is absorbed by constituent elements in the atmosphere. Due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum</a> nature of electrons, each atom and molecule can only absorb photons of specific wavelengths. Thus, we can identify the elements present in the atmosphere by the wavelengths of light that are absorbed. Typically, exoplanet researchers take many exposures over the course of a transit, then combine their data to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_spectroscopy#Absorption_spectrum">transmission spectrum</a> that shows how much light is absorbed at each wavelength. Instead of measuring the transmission spectrum exclusively, it is often advantageous to calculate the similarity between the observed spectrum and a computer-generated spectrum with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation">cross-correlation</a> method.</p>
        
                        <p>By analyzing these absorption features in detail, we can not only pinpoint the chemical makeup of the exoplanet's atmosphere but also probe the underlying physical processes. We can infer temperature gradients, wind speeds, and circulation patterns, claims which are made stronger via comparison to theoretical models.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the hot Jupiter transits, light from the star passes through different slices of the atmosphere, meaning that out transmission spectrum should change with time. As mentioned, observers commonly combine all exposures during transit together to maximize signal strength. Our research is unique in that we do not combine all of the exposures during transit together, but instead look at changes in the data with respect to time. This means that we can probe individual longitudinal slices of the atmosphere, gaining a considerably more detailed view of the atmospheric physics.</p>

                            to the Astronomical Journal in March 2025. This work was completed in collaboration with

                        <p>KELT-20b is a well-studied exoplanet within the highly observable ultra hot Jupiter (UHJ) regime, yet its multidimensional atmospheric structure remains largely unconstrained. Recent advances in instrumentation and increased general circulation model (GCM) complexity have enabled observers to resolve the imprints of more intricate physical mechanisms in time-resolved data. We performed high-resolution cross-correlation transmission spectroscopy (HRCCTS) on a single transit time series of KELT-20b, observed with PEPSI on the LBT. We detect Fe I (11.9σ) and Fe II (23.7σ) and tentatively detect Na I (3.4σ) and Cr I (3.3σ) upon combining nineteen in-transit exposures. The full-transit velocity offsets of the strongest absorbers are ΔV_Fe I = −1.0 ± 0.7 km/s and ΔV_Fe II = 0.0 ± 0.5 km/s. These results are discrepant with other HRCCTS studies of KELT-20b, but these studies are largely inconsistent with each other due to multiple possible factors, including self-inconsistent treatment of systemic velocity. In response, we establish a stringent set of detection criteria to promote reproducibility in future works. We present phase-resolved absorption traces of species with high detection significance. Fe I and Fe II's absorption traces are both redshifted at ingress, cross to a blueshift after mid-transit, then settle at a net blueshift at egress; concurrently, SNR increases with phase. This behavior is consistent with absorption traces post-processed from an active magnetic drag GCM for another UHJ. However, the net blueshift during transit could also result from limb asymmetry drivers and/or longitudinally variable wind structure. This ambiguity motivates future theoretical work on KELT-20b.</p>

                        <p>
                            During my research assistantship at the NSF Center for Industrial Sensors and Measurements 
                            with 
                            <a href="https://mse.osu.edu/people/akbar.1">Prof. Sheikh Akbar</a>
                            in the Ohio State Department of Materials Science and Engineering, I focused on 
                            manufacturing nanoscale metal-oxide gas sensors (MOGS) aimed at detecting hazardous 
                            gases at trace concentrations. My responsibilities included synthesizing nanostructures 
                            of various compositions, depositing them on substrates with diodes, and testing their 
                            sensitivity using electrical measurements. For reactive sensors, I documented their 
                            morphology and composition with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, 
                            archiving the results in the 
                            <a href="https://www.odorsdatabase.com/">Open Database of Resistive-type Sensors</a> 
                            (ODORS). I also compiled sensor data from current literature into ODORS, with the aim 
                            of developing a platform to identify trends in the selectivity and sensitivity of MOGS.
